# Generator Test Coverage Improvements

## Summary

Improved test coverage for the generator feature in PR #126 from 86.5% to 98.1%.

## Test Cases Added

### Unit Tests (pkg/generator/generator_test.go)

1. **File read error** - Tests when the generator YAML file cannot be read (e.g., is a directory)
2. **Invalid function annotation type** - Tests when the annotation is not a string (e.g., number)
3. **Malformed exec configuration** - Tests when the exec configuration YAML is invalid
4. **Empty exec path** - Tests when the exec path is specified but empty
5. **Generator execution failure** - Tests when the generator script exits with non-zero status
6. **Invalid YAML in generator output** - Tests when the generator outputs invalid YAML
7. **Multi-document YAML handling** - Tests generators that output multiple resources with empty documents

### Integration Tests (pkg/kustomize/kustomization_test.go)

1. **TestKustomizer_Generators** - New test suite that covers:
   - Successful generator processing
   - Generator errors propagation
   - Transformations applied to generated resources

### Test Fixtures Created

1. **generator-multi-doc** - Generator that outputs multiple resources
2. **generator-empty** - Generator that produces no output
3. **generator-failure** - Generator that fails with exit code 1

## Coverage Results

- **Before**: 86.5% coverage
- **After**: 98.1% coverage
- **Uncovered line**: Only line 76-78 (filepath.Abs error) remains uncovered as it's an edge case that's difficult to test without mocking

## Key Improvements

1. Comprehensive error handling coverage
2. Edge cases for multi-document YAML parsing
3. Integration with kustomize transformations
4. Real executable test fixtures for realistic testing
